**Plex Data Collector For InfluxDB**
------------------------------

This is a tool for collecting some basic info about your Plex server and sending it to InfluxDB.

**Usage**

Put your Plex and Influx info in config.ini and run plexInfluxdbCollector.py



***Requirements***

Python 3 

You will need the influxdb library installed to use this - [Found Here](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb-python)


I developed this on Windows with Python 3.5.  However, it should work with any version of Python 3 on Windows or Linux.
